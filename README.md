# level_control_simulation
Provides a modular Python simulation for tank‐level control, implementing Proportional, PI, Super‐Twisting Sliding Mode, Predefined‐Time, and Sliding Mode controllers. Integrates nonlinear dynamics with a 4th‐order Runge–Kutta solver under random inlet disturbances, plotting level, rate, control action, and flow. Ideal for education and research.
